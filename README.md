# Chasing Mice

https://spca-chasing-mice.herokuapp.com/

This Game is still under construction but is intended to be used for kids at the SF SPCA.

This is all pro-bono work and is intended to help educate kids about animal safety. If you would like to contribute, feel free to reach out to me via GitHub.
